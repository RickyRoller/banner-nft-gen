# Banner NFT ETHOnline Hackathon project

This app allows a user to generate and tweak a banner image that can be used for social media profiles. After the user
creates the image that they like, the image can be stored on IPFS and minted as an NFT on the rinkeby testnet.

### This project utilizes:
- IPFS/Pinata for metadata storage
- OpenZeppelin ERC-721 contract base
- Alchemy provider for communicating with the contract
- OpenSea API for fetching user NFTs
